Mapmaker V2 is a much slower and earlier Mapmaker project created in Python. It runs much slower than the now updated V3 (Taking minutes rather than seconds). This is here primarily for archival purposes.

The program is a .py file that can be run in IDLE and uses the modules PIL, numpy, and random. To run, make sure the pre-requisite modules are installed and run.

Created July 2023.
